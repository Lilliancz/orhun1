                Before you compete against two other people, we give you a choice. 
                <br><br>
                You may choose to compete in an environment where the score of each of the
                three players in Part 1 is shown to all players before they start the competition.
                We refer to this environment as <B>Firm A.</B>
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, you may choose to compete in an environment where every player
                (including you) knows only their own score in Part 1 and do not know the scores
                of the other two players in Part 1.  We refer to this environment as <B>Firm B.</B>
                <br><br>
                Your opponents will be randomly assigned to the firm you choose. In other words,
                they will not make a choice between Firm A and Firm B.
                <br><br>
                Summary: Firm A provides an environment where everyone competes after learning each
                others' performance in Part 1.<BR>
                Firm B provides an environment where people only know their own performance from Part 1.
                <br><br>
                Your choice will be implemented almost always. However, there is a small (15%) chance
                that you may be assigned
                to a different firm that the one you prefer, due to the structure of this study.<BR><BR>
                Please think carefully about each environment and how it might affect your performance.
                When you feel confident that you understood these instructions, please proceed.
                <br><br>
