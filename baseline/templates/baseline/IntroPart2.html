                Thank you for your participation. Now, we move onto Part 2 of the study. Please read these instructions carefully.
                <br><br>
                In this part, <B>you will compete with two other players</b> in a sequence of tasks like the one you saw earlier. Each player will have two minutes to complete as many problems correctly as possible.  Your competitors will get the exact same problems that you will get. After the two minutes are up, the player who has the most correct answers wins first place and a bonus of <b>$2.50</b>.  The player with the second most correct answers gets second place and wins a bonus of <b>$1.00</b>. The player with the least number of correct answers gets third place and and will not receive a bonus. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, it is important to <u>do your very best in the two minutes you have</u>. You will again see the clock counting down the time you have left.
